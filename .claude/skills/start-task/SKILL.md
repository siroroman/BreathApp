Do NOT use for questions, explanations, code reading, reviews, or when the session already works on a ticket and branch."

# Start task

Takes a request that changes the repo from a sentence to a ticket, a branch, a plan, a draft pull request and its review. Follow [git](../../../docs/agents/git.md) and [workflow](../../../docs/agents/workflow.md); this skill only sequences them.

Talk to the user in their language. Issue titles, bodies, branches and commits are English, like the rest of the repo.

## Critical

- Read the first user message before acting. When the skill is called as `/start-task <text>`, the text after the command is the request. If it asks for no change to the repo (question, explanation, review, reading), stop here and answer normally.
- Never edit files, create a branch or commit before the user has approved the plan (Step 5).
- Never create a second issue for work that already has one. Never guess in a doubtful match: ask.
- Never commit on `main`. Never merge the PR or mark it ready.

## Step 1: Find or create the issue

1. Search open and closed issues for the same work: `gh issue list --state all --search "<2-3 keywords>" --json number,title,state,url --limit 10`. Try a second query with other keywords when the first finds nothing.
2. Decide:
   - **One clear match**: use it. Say: "Issue #N (open/closed): title, link". Read it with `gh issue view N --json number,title,body,labels,comments`.
   - **No match**: create it with `gh issue create --title "<title>" --body "<body>"`. The body is a short description plus acceptance criteria as a checklist (the workflow does not start without them). Say "Created #N: title, link".
   - **Unclear** (several close matches, a closed issue that may be a regression, a request that spans several issues): show the candidates with links and ask which one to use, or whether to create a new one.
3. If the request is too vague to write acceptance criteria, ask the user before creating the issue.

Already on a feature branch whose name carries an issue number? Read that issue and reuse it instead of searching.

## Step 2: Show the card

Show these four lines and nothing more:

- **Issue**: #N, link
- **Type**: one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`, with a few words why
- **Branch**: `<type>/<issue-number>-<slug>`, the slug in 2-5 words
- **Title**: the issue title. **Description**: 1-3 plain sentences on the problem.

## Step 3: Offer a plan

Ask one question: "Do you want to plan the implementation?" Wait for the answer.

- **Yes** → Step 4.
- **No** → ask whether to start straight away; on yes go to Step 5 with the plan being the issue's acceptance criteria.

## Step 4: Plan

Enter plan mode (load `EnterPlanMode` through ToolSearch if it is deferred) and plan the work against the issue, `GLOSSARY.md`, the ADRs of the area and [testing](../../../docs/agents/testing.md). Exit plan mode with `ExitPlanMode`.

After exit, put a summary in the chat before asking for approval:

- 3-6 bullets, plain words, no file-level detail, what changes and what is tested
- a link to the plan file, using the path plan mode wrote to
- one question: approve the plan or change it

## Step 5: Implement

After approval:

1. `git fetch`, then branch from the latest main: `git switch -c <branch> origin/main`. Skip if the session is already on that branch.
2. Implement in red-green slices with the `tdd` skill, one commit per slice, Conventional Commits with `Refs #N` ([git](../../../docs/agents/git.md)).
3. Run `make gen build test lint`. For UI changes also `make run screenshot` ([commands](../../../docs/agents/commands.md)).

## Step 6: Wrap up

Summarize in short bullets, plain words:

- **Done**: what changed, as results, not files
- **Checks**: what passed and what was not run
- **Before the PR**: what is still open (UI screenshot, a failing check, a decision), or "nothing"

Before pushing run `make format lint` and read it to the last line (`0/N files require formatting.`); fix every error, a draft PR is opened only with a clean lint. If nothing blocks the PR, ask: "Create the pull request?" On yes push the branch (`git push -u origin <branch>`), run `scripts/pr-facts.sh`, and open a draft PR with the `pr` skill extended as in [pull requests](../../../docs/agents/pull-requests.md). The body ends with `Closes #N`. Check that the title is a valid Conventional Commit header.

## Step 7: Review

Right after the draft PR is open, start the `code-reviewer` agent with the Agent tool (`subagent_type: "code-reviewer"`). Give it the PR number and the issue number, nothing else: it starts with an empty context, so the review is fresh ([workflow](../../../docs/agents/workflow.md), step 6). It posts the review with a marker for the commit it reviewed, which `pr-review.yml` looks for.

- Put its findings in the chat as short bullets, **Blocking** first, then the **Notes**, and which acceptance criteria are not met or not shown.
- One review round only. Do not fix findings or mark the PR ready without the user. After the user agrees, fix only the **Blocking** findings, each with its evidence (a test that was red and is green, a command output), and push. The **Notes** are not fixed in this PR: offer them to the user as issues. The check accepts a review of an earlier commit of the PR, so do not start the agent again unless the user asks for it.
- After the push, show the user what came after the review: `git diff <reviewed sha>..HEAD` (the sha is in the marker of the review), as a short list of files and what changed. That diff is what no agent has reviewed.
- Marking the PR ready and merging are the user's.

## Examples

**New request, no issue**
User says: "Add a haptic tick on every breath phase change."
Actions: search finds nothing → create issue #130 with acceptance criteria → card (`feat`, `feat/130-haptic-phase-tick`) → ask about planning → user says yes → plan mode → bullets + plan link → approval → branch, implement, checks → summary → ask about the PR → draft PR → `code-reviewer` subagent.
Result: draft PR that closes #130, reviewed by the `code-reviewer` agent, with its findings in the chat.

**Request already has an issue**
User says: "Fix the timer drift."
Actions: search finds open #31 "Timer drifts in background" → "Issue #31 (open): link" → card with `fix/31-timer-drift-in-background` → continue as above.

**Pure question**
User says: "How does the pacer work?"
Actions: none from this skill, answer normally.

## Troubleshooting

- **`gh issue list` or `gh issue create` asks for permission**: they are not in the allow list of `.claude/settings.json`. The user approves each call, or adds them.
- **Commit refused on `main`**: the hook wants a branch. `git switch -c <branch>` and commit there.
- **Commit message rejected**: fix the header (type, 72 characters, imperative). Never use `--no-verify`.
- **The skill started in the middle of a ticket**: the session already has a branch and an issue. Skip to the step that matches where the work is.
